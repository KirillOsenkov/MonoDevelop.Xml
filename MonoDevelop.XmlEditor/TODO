MonoDevelop XML Editor Issues and TODO list
-------------------------------------------

This list should be moved to the SourceForge issues tracker.

* Cannot create an XML file with any extension other than .xml.  MonoDevelop problem.
* XML Editor has a list of file extensions that it recognises as XML content.  Really
  this should be using the mime type.  The XML editor add-in should install extra
  types into the mime type database.
* At the moment it only recognises the mime type "text/xml".  XSL files, for example,
  have a mime type of "text/xsl".  However, the XML editor checks the file extension
  as well so an XSL file will be opened in the XML editor.
* 11 unit tests are currently not working.  Atsushi Eno has been fixing issues as 
  quick as I can report them, so a lot of these unit tests should work under the
  next release of Mono.
* Autocompletion of elements, after typing in the greater than sign, is over zealous.
* The autocompletion list requires an icon.  I would prefer not to have one for
  XML completion, but at the moment it is using the stock forward icon.
* When validating XML documents errors are added to the task list by creating a 
  CompilerResult object.  There is no other way to create an error task.
* The XML menu option is displayed all the time.  In SharpDevelop I used the 
  activewindow property to show/hide the menu when the XML editor is being 
  used/not used.  Unable to get this working.
* Mixed namespace handling is limited.  The element completion list is based on the
  parent element at the current location.  Really this should take into account any
  other available namespaces that are allowed at that location.
* Commenting out regions of XML.  SharpDevelop implements this, but there are a few
  bugs.
* The "Show Schema Annotation" XML Editor option does nothing.  Schema annotation
  is always displayed if available.
